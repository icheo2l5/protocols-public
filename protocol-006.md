# FACS sample preparation for live cell sorting

## Summary
Describe how to prepare live cell samples for FACS to enrich certain populations.

## Materials
- Falcon round-bottom polystyrene test tubes with cell strainer snap cap, 5 mL
- Falcon round-bottom polystyrene test tubes, 5 mL
- Styrofoam box

### Reagents
- 2% FBS in PBS, cold.
- PBS
- Growth medium

## Procedures

1. Lift cells from the plate with TrypLE (or disassociation reagent of choice).
2. While waiting, prepare the following:
	- A styrofoam box with ice
	- 2% FBS in PBS, cold. Need roughly 1 mL per sample. Always prepare more.
	- FACS tubes (transparent cap) for collection. Fill with 1 mL growth medium.
3. Neutralize with at least 2X volume of growth media, and pellet the cells in a 15-mL conical tube by centrifuging at 300xg for 5 minutes at room temperature.
4. Remove supernatant carefully, then resuspend the cells with cold PBS with 2% FBS. Resuspend well with pipetting up and down to break cell clumps.

|    Vessel   |    Confluency    | Volume of PBS |        Density        |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 10-cm / T75 | almost confluent | 0.7-1.3 mL    | 5-10 million cells/mL |

5. Transfer resuspended cell solution in to a FACS tube (blue cap, with strainer).
	- Lift the cap a little bit when passing the liquid through.
	- Any cell clumps will be retained, and this will prevent potential clogging issue later.
6. Bring the following items over ice to the flow-cytometry core facility located in Moffett Lab (level 1).
	- Cell samples in blue-cap FACS tubes;
	- Collection tubes with growth medium (always bring more in case plan changes);
	- 2% FBS in PBS (in case need to further dilute the samples).
7. Bring sorted samples back after the sorting session. Plate into plates of appropriate size, with warm media pre-filled.
	- Before leaving for the sorting session, keep media in the water bath for later use, or pre-fill media in the plates/flasks and keep in the incubator.
